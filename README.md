# PROJECT_2_ETL
ETL Second Project

UPDATED THROUGH 7-27-19:  STARBUCKS, MCDONALD'S, WHOLEFOODS and Median Household Income. 
We plan to build a SQL database to support research regarding location of Starbucks, McDonald's, Wholefoods and Median Household income by zip code.  We plan to have a user website for access to the data for answering questions such as:  Is there any coorelation between STARBUCKS, MCDONALDS, WHOLE FOODS or other retail spaces and MEDIAN household income? or What are the median incomes per zip code?
or What zipcodes have the most concentrated representations of high end retail? or How many Starbucks and Wholefoods are present in what income brackets by Zip code?
 
TEAM consists of: John Goebel, Nick Weaver, Mohammed Irshad, and Carol Pietro
