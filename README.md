EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

"Welcome to our CWRU Bootcamp ETL project!  
Please review the documentation located on this site for use of the data contained within.  We welcome you to explore our data.   We selected these particular datasets and views after reading a related article on cbsnews.com, which analyzed the relationship between Starbucks and property values.  We chose to change the property value to median household income and also to add other retail components such as McDonalds and Wholefoods.   

Our team, John, Nick, Carol and Mohammad used the skills we have learned in the DataAnalytics bootcamp to bring to you a transformed set of data for use in answering potential questions like: Is there any coorelation between Starbucks, McDonalds, WholeFoods and median household income?  or How many Starbucks are located in what zipcodes?   What is the median household income by zipcode?

We plan to have a user website for access to the data for answering questions such as:  Is there any coorelation between STARBUCKS, MCDONALDS, WHOLE FOODS or other retail spaces and MEDIAN household income? or What are the median incomes per zip code?
or What zipcodes have the most concentrated representations of high end retail? or How many Starbucks and Wholefoods are present in what income brackets by Zip code?
